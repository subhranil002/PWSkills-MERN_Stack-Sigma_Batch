                    Six months after Jobs’s death, the author of his
                    best-selling biography identifies the practices that every
                    CEO can try to emulate.

                    writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents’
                    garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it
                    from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in
                    October 2011, had built it into the world’s most valuable
                    company. Along the way he helped to transform seven
                    industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,
                    phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital
                    publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America’s
                    great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and
                    Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after
                    their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how
                    they applied imagination to technology and business.

                    One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished
                    writing most of the book, I asked him again about his
                    tendency to be rough on people. “Look at the results,” he
                    replied. “These are all smart people I work with, and any of
                    them could get a top job at another place if they were truly
                    feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused for a
                    few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some
                    amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string
                    of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that
                    of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod,
                    iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone,
                    iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every Pixar film.
                    And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by
                    an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired
                    by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
                    children.
