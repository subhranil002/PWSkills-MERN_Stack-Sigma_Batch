Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build and execute server-side applications using JavaScript. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it suitable for building scalable and efficient network applications.Node.js's architecture enables developers to build scalable and performant applications, especially in scenarios where high concurrency and real-time communication are important. It's commonly used for web servers, APIs, real-time applications, microservices, and more.Compared to other server-side languages, Node js has distinct advantages. Its asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve the scalability and performance of web applications built on other frameworks. Node js can easily handle multiple client requests without requiring multiple threads, consuming less memory and resources. Additionally, it is highly scalable and provides high performance. Node js is also flexible with multiple frameworks and makes the development process easier.
